The wonderful folks over at [Sixty Symbols](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBqzzvUBLCs8Y7Axb-jZew) featured entropic self-assembly research done by the Glotzer Group (in particular that of [Michael Engel](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~engelmm/). While most people think of entropy as *disorder*, we can in fact use entropy to form and control *ordered* structures.
